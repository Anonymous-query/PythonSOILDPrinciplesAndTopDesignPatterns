## Creational
* Singleton Pattern
* Factory Method Pattern
* Builder Pattern

**Creational Design Patterns** that manage object creation mechanisms. They are designed to create objects in flexible and highly adaptable ways. These patterns offer the most reusable and flexible way of creating object instances.

## Structural
* Adapter Pattern

**Structural Design Patterns** that improve and simplify your design by identifying the most efficient and reusable way to compose relationships among entities. This allows for the best and most efficient ways of creating complex hierarchies of objects.


## Behavioral
* Strategy Pattern
* Observer Pattern
* State Pattern

**Behavioral Design Patterns** that improve interaction and communication between objects. These patterns offer loosely coupled ways of allowing objects to 'talk' to each other and exchange messages.

*Just remember these pattern families:*

**Creational:**     Deals with ways of creating objects of objects.

**Structural:**     Deals with ways of managing complex object hierarchies.

**Behavioral:**     Deals with ways of identifying and improving object messaging.
