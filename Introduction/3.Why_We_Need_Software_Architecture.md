### Complex software systems are plagued with many issues:
    1. **Timelines are stretched** as requirements change.
    2. Multiple developers have **hard time coordinating** their efforts.
    3. Often there is **Code redundancy** and poor documentation.

This in turn creates issues with **maintenance** and overall flexibility to **adding new features**.

In general, this means poorly designed systems that are hard to maintain, and **are not adaptable**.
